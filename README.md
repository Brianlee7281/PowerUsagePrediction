1. Objective
    1. The objective of this project is to accurately forecast electricity consumption to ensure a stable and efficient energy supply. By leveraging temporal data and meteorological features, this machine learning model is designed to discover power demand (electricity usage) forecasting algorithms that can be actively deployed in industrial settings. This project serves to explore and validate the practical applicability of machine learning regression model in real-world energy management
2. Data
    1. This machine learning model leverages temporal and meteorological factors that influence energy demand. Non-numerical and categorical data types were conversed into numerical data types, and because weather feature have vastly difference scales, StandardScaler was applied for preprocessing. The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s forecasting accuracy on unseen future data.
3. Used Model
    1. Before testing out different regression models, K-Means Clustering was applied to discover groupings within the provided data. Elbow Method was utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters. 
    2. Then, to evaluate a set of regression algorithms, PyCaret was leveraged and allowed for comparison of different regression model performances. 
    3. Based on the PyCaret results, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Huber regressors were chosen. With the Decision Tree Regressor, key hyper parameters were max_depth for preventing tree’s overgrowing and min_samples_split to control the minimum number of samples required to split in a node. In KNN Regressor, key hyper parameters were n_neighbors and weights to determinate number of closest data points to consider. With the Huber Regressor, alpha and epsilon was used. To maximize forecasting accuracy for electricity consumption, a Stacking Regressor was implemented with the tree chosen models.

4. Outcome
    1. The final model demonstrated strong forecasting accuracy, effectively capturing the patterns in electricity consumption influenced by temporal and meteorological factors. The use of clustering as an additional feature and the stacking ensemble approach contributed significantly to the model's performance. This project highlights the practical applicability of machine learning in energy management, showcasing how advanced regression techniques and feature engineering can be used to forecast electricity consumption accurately. The pipeline developed in this project can be further extended and deployed in real-world industrial settings to optimize energy supply and demand.
